# Simulation decisions (S-)

Decisions of the headless simulation stream: `src/shared` (except `Defs/Blockouts/`), `src/server`, `.lune/`, balance and stress tooling. Progress is in [`../progress/sim.md`](../progress/sim.md). Earlier decisions (D1–D109, both areas before the split) are in [`../DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md).

Each entry gives the date, the decision, the alternatives and the reason. Overrule any of them and the code, the guide and this file are updated together.

## Summary

- S-1: network contract `docs/contracts/net.md`; projectile math moved to Shared.
- S-2: join / reconnect snapshot and the Eco channel (protocol 6).

## S-1 — Network contract; projectile math in Shared (2026-10-21)

- **Contract:** `docs/contracts/net.md` describes everything the client receives (protocol 5) and the join snapshot and Eco channel coming as protocol 6 (S-2).
  - The sim stream owns it: the layouts are `Shared/Net/Schema`'s, and the rules NetOut's.
  - `Tests/Support/Client.luau` is the reference receiver. When the two disagree, the code wins and the contract is fixed.
- **Projectile math in Shared:** `Ballistics` moved from `src/server/Sim/Combat/` to `src/shared/Combat/Ballistics.luau`, so the Roblox client can step projectiles with the server's exact math (`step`) and turn homing ones with its steering (`steer`, moved from Projectiles).
  - The old path is a one-line shim, so server requires are unchanged.
  - The headless client uses `Ballistics.steer` too.
  - Alternative: a client-only copy of the math, which would drift from the server's. Rejected.

## S-2 — Join / reconnect snapshot and the Eco channel (2026-10-21; guide 7.5)

- **Handshake** (Snapshot channel, `PROTOCOL_VERSION` 6):
  - HELLO (C → S): protocol, defs hash.
  - REJECT (S → C): the server's versions, reason 1 protocol / 2 defs.
  - WELCOME (S → C): full u32 tick, player, team, ally team, map ID.
  - `NetOut.hello` checks; `NetOut.join` queues the WELCOME.
- **No separate snapshot format:**
  - The join resets the player's replication state (tactical set, known projectiles, homing view) and forces a full strategic snapshot and an Eco record in the next outbox.
  - The normal channels then rebuild the view: ENTER for the camera area (a reconnect keeps the camera), strategic records for everything else, SPAWN_PROJ for projectiles in view.
  - Alternative: one big snapshot message with every unit's state. Rejected: it would duplicate every layout, and the normal path is already tested for exactness.
- **Eco channel:** one 35 B record per change, on economy ticks (every 5th tick), for the player's team only.
  - Per resource: stored, storage (whole units), income, demand (tenths per second), stall ratio (u8).
  - Then the wind (u8).
- **Tests:**
  - `NetOut.spec`: two identical runs of a battle, one client connected throughout and one joining at tick 300. The views are identical five ticks later (units, tiers, positions, icons, flags, unguided projectiles, economy), and the sim hashes match. Without the reset it fails.
  - HELLO accepts, rejects with each reason, and errors on garbage.
  - Eco values match the account.
  - `Schema.spec`: golden bytes, round trips, truncation and rejections for the new records.
