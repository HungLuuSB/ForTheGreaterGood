# Progress

Status of the unattended work session. A new session should be able to continue from this file alone.

## Summary (end of the unattended session, 2026-10-20)

**Done: all 10 tasks, plus the rules review.** Branch `m0-foundations` is pushed; every task is its own commit.

| # | Task | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Packer/Schema follow-ups, guide 0.4 | `e1be1c4` |
| 2 | Defs: loader, validation, indices, hash, Lancer/Ravager | `67b89b8` |
| 3 | Grid: cell math, wire positions, test maps | `e18c19c` |
| 4 | World, Sim.step, replay log, world hash (**M0 exit criteria met**) | `6d79a93` |
| 5 | Passability: slope, passMask, clearance | `b615360` |
| 6 | Quadtree, coarse A*, corridor | `ddcea5e` |
| 7 | Flow fields, time-slicing, LRU cache | `089a316` |
| 8 | Flow field benchmark | `49bbc74` |
| 9 | Movement, shared fields, avoidance | `7fe1b02` |
| 10 | Combat core (targeting → damage), headless | `2b8110c` |
| — | Rules review, final docs | (last commit) |

**Tests:** `lune run test` gives **17 specs, 129 passed, 0 failed** (about 1.5 s). Key mechanisms were mutation-checked: each deliberately broken version was caught by the specs.

**Benchmarks** (Lune, dev PC; details below):
- One-shot flow fields on 256×256 take 80 ms (open), 31.5 ms (maze) and 9.9 ms (island). All are **over** the 8 ms budget.
- Sliced at 12,000 work units per tick they finish in 11, 8 and 2 ticks.
- 50-unit marches cost about 0.2 ms per tick. The 10 v 10 duel costs about 0.024 ms per tick.

**Results:**
- 50 Lancers arrive on all 9 test maps (lakes and wall-with-gap) without overlap. About 70% land within 2 studs of their formation slot, and the worst lands about 17 studs short.
- The 10 v 10 duel always ends: Chaos wins 10 of 10 seeds with placeholder stats.
- Every run is deterministic and replays exactly.

**Decisions:** D1–D51 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. The ones that change the guide or need your call are listed under *Questions*.

**Questions for you:**
1. **D21, footprint rule.** I used `clearance >= floor(F/2) + 1` (the guide's `ceil(F/2)` lets a 2×2 unit into a 1-cell gap). Even footprints then need a gap one cell wider than strictly necessary. Keep it, or switch to exact corner-anchored clearance?
2. **D29/D33, pathing budget in work units** (12,000 per tick), not wall-clock ms, so replays stay exact. Confirm?
3. **Benchmark: fields are over budget.** Pick the next optimization: bucket-queue Dijkstra (about 2×), tighter corridors, `--!native` and Actors (needs Studio/live measurements), or accept the slicing.
4. **D50, balance.** Ravagers win the close duel 10 of 10. Is that intended by the doctrine (Chaos brawls, Order out-ranges)? Should a long-range test scenario be added?
5. **D51, cross-platform determinism.** sin, cos and atan2 come from the platform's libm, so a replay recorded on a Linux server may diverge when replayed on Windows. Accept same-platform replays, or should I write deterministic trig?
6. **Formation precision** (about 70% exact). Good enough for now, or invest in better slot assignment?
7. Still pending from before: Studio access for the darklua require pipeline and the Studio test entry.

---

## How to continue

- Branch: `m0-foundations` (pushed to `origin`). Run `lune run test` from the repo root; everything must pass before starting the next task.
- Rules: `CLAUDE.md`, the `ftgg-roblox-dev` skill and the design guide (`docs/For_The_Greater_Good_Design_Guide.md`).
- Unattended-session rules (from the user):
  - After each task passes the tests: commit, push, and update this file.
  - When something is unclear, decide, log it in `docs/DECISIONS.md` and continue.
  - Stop only if a test can't be made to pass, or a change would delete or rewrite existing work.
  - Never weaken a test to make it pass.
  - Simulation code only: nothing that needs Studio.
  - Debug output goes in `debug_out/`, which is gitignored.

## Done so far

### Task 2 — Defs

- `src/shared/Defs/`:
  - `Defs.luau`: validate, build, load, hash.
  - `Templates.luau`: `extend`, `Unit`, `TankT1`.
  - `Registry.luau`, plus `Categories`, `ArmorClasses` and `MoveClasses`.
  - `Units/ord_lancer`, `Units/chs_ravager`, `Weapons/ord_light_cannon`, `Weapons/chs_light_cannon`.
- `src/shared/Util/Hash.luau`: FNV-1a 32 plus a canonical value hash.
- Specs: `Defs.spec` (valid load, indices, derived values, extend, freeze, hash, missing damage logged, 28 broken-def cases, aggregated errors) and `Hash.spec`.
- Tests: **6 specs, 51 passed, 0 failed**.
- Decisions: D1–D7 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

### Task 3 — Grid

- `src/shared/Grid/`:
  - `Grid.luau`: 8-stud cells up to 256×256, centered on the origin; index/coords, cellAt, cellCenter, encode/decode (error in [0, 1/32) stud, clamped to the map), 16-stud sensor cells.
  - `Layers.luau`: height and waterDepth as i16 in 0.25-stud steps.
  - `TestMap.luau`: seeded 3-octave value-noise hills with water below sea level, plus `build()` for hand-made maps.
- `.lune/lib/Ppm.luau` (PPM and PNG writer) and `.lune/debug_map.luau`. `lune run debug_map [seed] [cells]` writes `debug_out/map_<seed>.png`.
- Specs: `Grid.spec` (sizes, index round-trip, boundaries, 15,000 random encode/decode round-trips within 1/32 stud, clamping, sensor cells) and `TestMap.spec` (quantization, determinism per seed, water consistency, 256×256).
- Tests: **8 specs, 64 passed, 0 failed**.
- Decisions: D8–D12.

### Task 4 — World, Sim, replay

- `src/server/Sim/`:
  - `World.luau`: SoA fields, dense `ids` list, fresh-first IDs with FIFO reuse after 150 ticks, dirty-bit setters, hash.
  - `Sim.luau`: `new`/`submit`/`step`/`hash`/`fromReplay`/`runReplay`; 11 systems in guide order with rates and Profiler labels; checkpoint every 300 ticks.
  - `Replay.luau`: binary log with header, COMMAND and CHECKPOINT entries.
  - `Scenarios.luau` (`empty`, `skirmish_test`), `Types.luau`.
  - `Systems/Commands.luau`: applies fire state, move state and toggle to the sender's own units. The other 10 systems are stubs.
- `Packer` gained `writeString`, `readString` and `readBuffer`.
- Specs:
  - `World.spec`: dense ids, delayed FIFO reuse after exhausting all 65,535 IDs, dirty bits, order-independent hash.
  - `Replay.spec`: round-trip, every truncated prefix, bad magic/format/kind.
  - `Sim.spec`: system order; 1,000 ticks twice give identical checkpoints and hash; a different seed differs; replay reproduces the run and re-records an identical log; an injected command and a corrupted checkpoint are both caught; protocol/defs mismatch refused; malformed submits dropped; ownership respected.
- Tests: **11 specs, 83 passed, 0 failed**.
- **M0 exit criteria met.** CLAUDE.md's milestone line now says M1.
- Decisions: D13–D20.

### Task 5 — Passability

- `src/shared/Grid/Passability.luau`: `build(layers)` produces:
  - the slope layer (u8);
  - passMask (u16, bit per move class: ford/slope for land, depth for ships and subs, any water for hover, slope only for amphib, air always);
  - per-class clearance (Chebyshev distance transform, map edge counts as blocked).

  Plus `canEnter`, `clearance`, `fits(moveClass, footprint, cell)` and `requiredClearance(F) = floor(F/2) + 1`.
- About 75 ms per 256×256 map in Lune (load time only).
- Specs (`Passability.spec`):
  - an exact slope value;
  - a depth table across all 9 classes (ships only on deep water, subs deeper, ford limits);
  - a 26.5° ramp that blocks HEAVY_TRACKED, WHEELED and HOVER but not TRACKED or AMPHIB;
  - exact clearance on a hand-built map;
  - a footprint-2 unit rejected in a 1-cell gap and accepted in a 3-cell gap;
  - generated-map invariants and the Lipschitz property of clearance.
- Tests: **12 specs, 92 passed, 0 failed**.
- Decisions: D21–D24. **D21 changes the guide's footprint formula. Please confirm.**

### Task 6 — Quadtree and coarse route

- `src/server/Sim/Path/`:
  - `Heap.luau`: deterministic (k1, k2, id) min-heap, reusable.
  - `Quadtree.luau`: per (move class, need); summed-area uniformity; edge-sharing neighbors; components.
  - `Route.luau`: A* over leaves with failure reasons, plus `corridor()` (route leaves + adjacent open leaves, mask buffer + bounding box).
- Measured on 256×256 hilly terrain: tree about 6 ms (4,285 leaves, 2,413 open); corner-to-corner route about 2.5 ms (40 leaves); corridor 0.15 ms (20,545 cells).
- Specs (`Route.spec`):
  - heap ordering;
  - flat 256² collapses to 1 leaf, 200×120 to ≤ 64 leaves, generated terrain < 1/4 of cells;
  - partition, symmetric neighbors, and components identical to cell flood-fill;
  - a route around a wall goes through the gap, with consecutive leaves touching and the goal reachable inside the corridor;
  - island, blocked goal and blocked start fail with the right reasons;
  - a 1-cell gap passes footprint 1 but not footprint 2;
  - a same-leaf route; determinism.
- Tests: **13 specs, 99 passed, 0 failed**.
- Decisions: D25–D28.

### Task 7 — Flow fields

- `src/server/Sim/Path/FlowField.luau`:
  - a job runs Dijkstra from the goal over corridor cells (8-connected, √2 diagonals, no corner cutting), then a direction pass (u8, 255 = none);
  - `run(job, budget)` is time-sliced in work units and resumes exactly;
  - plus `build`, `direction`, `covers`, `vector`.
- `src/server/Sim/Path/FieldCache.luau`: LRU (default 32) keyed by `moveClass:need:goal`; hit/miss/eviction stats; `invalidateCell`.
- `.lune/debug_flowfield.luau`: `lune run debug_flowfield [maze|hills] [seed]` writes `debug_out/flowfield_<kind>.png` (cost shading plus direction ticks).
- `src/server/Tests/Support/Maps.luau`: shared test map builders (flat with water, zig-zag maze, field from start to goal).
- Specs (`FlowField.spec`):
  - from every corridor cell, following the field reaches the goal without leaving the corridor or cutting corners (wall map, maze, generated terrain);
  - integration equals the octile distance on open ground;
  - the pinch-corner case;
  - sliced output equals one-shot for budgets 1, 7, 64 and 1000;
  - vectors; cache hits, LRU eviction and invalidation.
- Tests: **14 specs, 107 passed, 0 failed**.
- Decisions: D29–D32. **D29 (work-unit budgets) changes how guide 6.4's "8 ms" is enforced. Please confirm.**

### Task 8 — Benchmark

- `.lune/bench.luau`: `lune run bench [runs]` times passability, quadtree, route, corridor and flow field on 256×256 open/maze/island maps (west-to-east endpoints, TRACKED, footprint 1). It prints a table and writes `debug_out/bench.txt`.
- Results below. No optimization was done, as instructed.
- Tests: unchanged (**14 specs, 107 passed**).
- Decision: D33.

### Task 9 — Movement and local avoidance

- `src/shared/Grid/MapRegistry.luau`: `none`, `flat:<n>`, `wall:<n>`, `gen:<seed>:<n>`. The sim loads its map from `mapId` (D34).
- `src/server/Sim/Nav.luau`: movement profiles, lazy quadtrees, field cache, the job FIFO, move orders with group fields and per-unit slots (spiral formation or line), goal snapping, field extension, and line-of-sight checks.
- Systems:
  - `Pathing`: runs field jobs within 12,000 work units per tick.
  - `Movement`: steer, move with terrain sliding, overlap resolution, write-back with dirty bits.
  - `Commands`: MOVE/FIGHT/PATROL (with LINE) and STOP now have effects.
- `World` gained movement fields (speed, orderId, goal, direct, progress), all hashed. `Route.findMany` and `Route.mergeCorridors` were added. Scenario `march_test` places 50 Lancers on the west side.
- `.lune/debug_movement.luau`: `lune run debug_movement [mapId] [ticks]` writes `debug_out/movement_<map>.png` with tracks and prints arrival statistics.
- Specs (`Movement.spec`):
  - 50 units cross a lake map, and 50 units detour through a wall's gap: all finish within 2,000 ticks, end ≤ 24 studs from their slots on open ground, and overlap at most 0.5 stud;
  - one order shares one field with distinct slots;
  - same seed gives identical positions and hash, and the replay reproduces it;
  - line-move goals are evenly spaced end to end, and units reach them;
  - a water goal snaps to land;
  - STOP; out-of-map cells are ignored;
  - idle units stay clean (no dirty bits).
- Tests: **15 specs, 115 passed, 0 failed**.
- Bugs found and fixed: the job FIFO used `table.insert` on a queue with nil head slots, so extension jobs never ran. Arrived units were shoved away by later arrivals.
- Decisions: D34–D42.

Movement results (`lune run debug_movement`, 50 Lancers west → east, Lune on the dev PC):

| map | ticks to all arrived | sim ms/tick | fields built | units ≤ 2 studs from slot | worst distance from slot | closest pair gap at end |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gen:7:96 | 461 | 0.18 | 2 | 34/50 | 13.7 | −0.00 |
| gen:3:96 | 404 | 0.18 | 1 | 47/50 | 6.3 | +0.07 |
| gen:11:128 | 532 | 0.17 | 1 | 45/50 | 5.3 | −0.00 |
| gen:21:128 | 628 | 0.17 | 2 | 33/50 | 11.7 | −0.20 |
| gen:5:96 | 477 | 0.17 | 1 | 27/50 | 7.3 | −0.00 |
| flat:64 | 312 | 0.14 | 1 | 45/50 | 14.0 | −0.00 |
| wall:64 | 431 | 0.18 | 5 | 25/50 | 5.8 | −0.00 |
| wall:96 | 597 | 0.20 | 5 | 32/50 | 16.5 | −0.00 |
| wall:128 | 757 | 0.24 | 6 | 26/50 | 14.8 | −0.00 |

Every unit arrives on every map and overlap is negligible. Formation precision is mediocre: about 70% of units end within 2 studs of their slot, and the rest stop up to about 17 studs short where the crowd blocks them (D38 give-up). Better slot assignment (e.g. Hungarian matching, or reserving the approach lane) is a possible follow-up.

### Task 10 — Combat core

- `src/server/Sim/Combat/`:
  - `Combat.luau`: per-def collision and weapon profiles, terrain height, damage queue, `explode` with AoE falloff and friendly fire, projectile pool (u16 IDs, cap 2,000), wrecks, per-tick events, hash.
  - `ContactGrid.luau`: 64-stud buckets, team-filtered queries.
  - `Ballistics.luau`: low-arc launch pitch, exact step, segment vs cylinder, distance to cylinder, falloff.
- Systems:
  - `Targeting`: per weapon, staggered, sticky, priority scoring, fire states.
  - `Weapons`: turret yaw/pitch rates, tolerance, ballistic pitch, reload, spread from `sim.rng`, hitscan resolution, projectile spawn.
  - `Projectiles`: exact flight, swept collision against enemy cylinders and terrain, impact explosions, ttl.
  - `Damage`: queued damage by armor class, lastAttacker, deaths with severity, wrecks, DEATH events, order cleanup.
- `World` has per-weapon state (yaw, pitch, reload, target) and lastAttacker, all hashed. `Sim/Spawn.luau` spawns from defs. Scenario `duel_test`. `Sim.hash` includes combat.
- `.lune/debug_duel.luau`: `lune run debug_duel [seeds]` prints the duel outcome, shots, hits, kills and cost.
- Specs:
  - `Ballistics.spec`: launch pitch lands on target; reach; exact step; segment/cylinder cases including no tunneling; distance; falloff.
  - `Combat.spec`:
    - 10 Lancers vs 10 Ravagers until one side is gone, deterministic across runs and replay;
    - a slow turret (30°/s) first fires ≥60 ticks after a fast one (180°/s);
    - exact AoE falloff for 5 units at known distances, and friendly fire off spares allies;
    - a shell blast damages 3 tanks with the exact falloff from the impact point;
    - hitscan damage lands the same tick;
    - a 3,000 stud/s rail doesn't tunnel, and an ally in the line of fire is untouched;
    - wreck vs. obliteration by overkill; armor classes;
    - Hold Fire stays silent; Return Fire shoots back only after being attacked.
  - Mutation checks: letting projectiles hit allies, ignoring aim tolerance, and dropping the swept test were each caught.
- `Sim.spec`: "20 units after 1,000 ticks" became "both runs end with the same survivors", since the skirmish tanks now fight. The determinism check is stricter, not weaker.
- Tests: **17 specs, 129 passed, 0 failed**.
- Duel results (`lune run debug_duel 10`): Chaos wins 10 of 10 seeds with 5 Ravagers left after 221–244 ticks (about 15 s). 96–97% of shells hit, 15 kills and 15 wrecks per fight, about 0.024 ms per tick for 20 units. Placeholder stats; see D50.
- Decisions: D43–D50.

### Rules review

Checked every file under `src/` against CLAUDE.md and the skill:

- `--!strict` everywhere. ✅
- Requires: only `@shared/...` across roots and relative paths within a root. ✅
- No Roblox globals, Instances, `Random`, `math.random`, `os.clock`/`tick`/`time` in sim code (clocks only via `Util/Profiler`). ✅
- No `pairs()`-order dependence: every loop over a hash-keyed table only builds a set or copy, or sorts its keys first. ✅
- Replicated fields are written only through World setters (dirty bits); turret aim sets STATE dirty explicitly. ✅
- No print spam in sim code. ✅

Fixes made during the review and while building the tasks:

1. **Hot-loop allocations removed:**
   - Targeting created a closure per weapon per tick; it's now a module-level function.
   - `Nav.tree` built a string key per call from Movement; the key is now precomputed per profile.
2. **Queue bugs fixed:** two FIFO queues used `table.insert` / `#` on tables with nil head slots: World's free-ID queue (caught in review before tests) and Nav's job queue (caught by the wall-map march). Both now use explicit head and tail indices.
3. **Unused require** (`World` in Scenarios) removed. Stale guide reference (line of fire is now 10.8) fixed. `Route.findMany` edge case simplified.
4. **Logged, not fixed:** D51 (libm trigonometry across platforms).

Remaining allocations per event (FIRE, IMPACT and DEATH event tables; command-time tables in Nav) are per discrete event, not per unit per tick.

### Round 3 — answers, pathing fixes, duel reports

- The answers were applied:
  - D21 is confirmed; guide 5.5 now requires chokepoints ≥ 3 cells and 6.2 prefers odd footprints.
  - Work-unit budgets are approved.
  - Same-platform re-simulation is accepted; guide 17.1 separates player-facing stream replays from dev-only command re-simulation.
  - Test audit: no hard-coded simulation hashes.
- **Fix (a), direct-path shortcut (D52):** each unit's line to its slot is checked once (same leaf is exact and free, otherwise sampled). Units with a clear line steer directly, and a field is built only for the rest, or not at all. All 9 movement maps still arrive. Open maps build 0 fields.

## Benchmarks

Lune 0.11 on the dev PC, 256×256, median over 7 runs (best in the second figure), ms:

| map | passability (load) | quadtree | route | corridor cells | **flow field** | of which integration | work units | units/ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| open | 77 | 1.4 | 0.00 (1 leaf) | 65,536 | **80.2** / 78.3 | 70.1 | 131,071 | 1,634 |
| maze (zig-zag, 16-cell spacing) | 76 | 12.0 | 9.1 (707 leaves) | 43,141 | **31.5** / 31.3 | 24.7 | 86,281 | 2,742 |
| island (r = 110, hills + lakes) | 76 | 5.5 | 1.3 (32 leaves) | 10,236 | **9.9** / 9.8 | 8.3 | 20,471 | 2,076 |

**Against the 8 ms Pathing budget (guide 18.1): every one-shot field is over budget.**

- Open: 10× over. Maze: 4× over. Island: 1.2× over.
- With deterministic slicing at 12,000 units per tick (D33), the fields complete in 11, 8 and 2 ticks (0.73 s, 0.53 s, 0.13 s). Units steer straight toward the goal until then, which guide 6.4 allows.
- Integration (Dijkstra with a binary heap) is about 85% of the cost.
- The open map is the worst case: the whole map is one leaf, so the corridor is all 65,536 cells.

**After fix (a), direct-path shortcut.** `lune run bench` now also times whole move orders (issue + jobs to completion), median ms:

| map | 1 unit | fields | 50-unit block | fields |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| open | **0.02** | 0 | **0.35** | 0 |
| maze | 44.7 | 1 | 45.1 | 1 |
| island | 14.0 | 1 | 17.6 | 1 |

The open-map worst case (one 80 ms field) is gone. Without the same-leaf test, sampling 50 long lines took 8.4 ms. Maze and island still need their fields; the order cost there adds the leaf route (about 9 ms in the maze) to the field.

Suggested fixes, in order of value per effort (as listed before fix (a)):

1. **No field when start and goal share an open leaf.** A leaf is a passable square, so the straight line inside it is always clear. This removes the open-map worst case entirely and helps every route's last leaf. *Cheap; will be used in task 9.*
2. **Bucket queue instead of a binary heap.** Integer costs 10/14 with Dial's algorithm make queue operations O(1). Expect about 2× on integration.
3. **Tighter corridor on open terrain.** Clip huge padding leaves to the route's bounding box plus a margin (D28 option).
4. **`--!native` on the path modules.** Roblox servers run Luau native codegen; numeric loops like these typically gain 1.5–3×. Must be measured on a live server.
5. **Actors (guide 6.4).** Move integration off the main thread so the main-thread budget only covers dispatch and apply. Results must be applied at a deterministic tick (D29).
6. **Cache hits.** All units in one order share a field, and repeated orders to the same goal hit the LRU, so real per-tick load is far below one field per order.
