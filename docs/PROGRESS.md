# Progress

Status of the unattended work session. A new session should be able to continue from this file alone.

## How to continue

- Branch: `m0-foundations` (pushed to `origin`). Run `lune run test` from the repo root; everything must pass before starting the next task.
- Rules: `CLAUDE.md`, the `ftgg-roblox-dev` skill and the design guide (`docs/For_The_Greater_Good_Design_Guide.md`).
- Unattended-session rules (from the user):
  - After each task passes the tests: commit, push, and update this file.
  - When something is unclear, decide, log it in `docs/DECISIONS.md` and continue.
  - Stop only if a test can't be made to pass, or a change would delete or rewrite existing work.
  - Never weaken a test to make it pass.
  - Simulation code only: nothing that needs Studio.
  - Debug output goes in `debug_out/`, which is gitignored.

## Done so far

### Task 2 — Defs

- `src/shared/Defs/`:
  - `Defs.luau`: validate, build, load, hash.
  - `Templates.luau`: `extend`, `Unit`, `TankT1`.
  - `Registry.luau`, plus `Categories`, `ArmorClasses` and `MoveClasses`.
  - `Units/ord_lancer`, `Units/chs_ravager`, `Weapons/ord_light_cannon`, `Weapons/chs_light_cannon`.
- `src/shared/Util/Hash.luau`: FNV-1a 32 plus a canonical value hash.
- Specs: `Defs.spec` (valid load, indices, derived values, extend, freeze, hash, missing damage logged, 28 broken-def cases, aggregated errors) and `Hash.spec`.
- Tests: **6 specs, 51 passed, 0 failed**.
- Decisions: D1–D7 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

### Task 3 — Grid

- `src/shared/Grid/`:
  - `Grid.luau`: 8-stud cells up to 256×256, centered on the origin; index/coords, cellAt, cellCenter, encode/decode (error in [0, 1/32) stud, clamped to the map), 16-stud sensor cells.
  - `Layers.luau`: height and waterDepth as i16 in 0.25-stud steps.
  - `TestMap.luau`: seeded 3-octave value-noise hills with water below sea level, plus `build()` for hand-made maps.
- `.lune/lib/Ppm.luau` (PPM and PNG writer) and `.lune/debug_map.luau`. `lune run debug_map [seed] [cells]` writes `debug_out/map_<seed>.png`.
- Specs: `Grid.spec` (sizes, index round-trip, boundaries, 15,000 random encode/decode round-trips within 1/32 stud, clamping, sensor cells) and `TestMap.spec` (quantization, determinism per seed, water consistency, 256×256).
- Tests: **8 specs, 64 passed, 0 failed**.
- Decisions: D8–D12.

### Task 4 — World, Sim, replay

- `src/server/Sim/`:
  - `World.luau`: SoA fields, dense `ids` list, fresh-first IDs with FIFO reuse after 150 ticks, dirty-bit setters, hash.
  - `Sim.luau`: `new`/`submit`/`step`/`hash`/`fromReplay`/`runReplay`; 11 systems in guide order with rates and Profiler labels; checkpoint every 300 ticks.
  - `Replay.luau`: binary log with header, COMMAND and CHECKPOINT entries.
  - `Scenarios.luau` (`empty`, `skirmish_test`), `Types.luau`.
  - `Systems/Commands.luau`: applies fire state, move state and toggle to the sender's own units. The other 10 systems are stubs.
- `Packer` gained `writeString`, `readString` and `readBuffer`.
- Specs:
  - `World.spec`: dense ids, delayed FIFO reuse after exhausting all 65,535 IDs, dirty bits, order-independent hash.
  - `Replay.spec`: round-trip, every truncated prefix, bad magic/format/kind.
  - `Sim.spec`: system order; 1,000 ticks twice give identical checkpoints and hash; a different seed differs; replay reproduces the run and re-records an identical log; an injected command and a corrupted checkpoint are both caught; protocol/defs mismatch refused; malformed submits dropped; ownership respected.
- Tests: **11 specs, 83 passed, 0 failed**.
- **M0 exit criteria met.** CLAUDE.md's milestone line now says M1.
- Decisions: D13–D20.

### Task 5 — Passability

- `src/shared/Grid/Passability.luau`: `build(layers)` produces:
  - the slope layer (u8);
  - passMask (u16, bit per move class: ford/slope for land, depth for ships and subs, any water for hover, slope only for amphib, air always);
  - per-class clearance (Chebyshev distance transform, map edge counts as blocked).

  Plus `canEnter`, `clearance`, `fits(moveClass, footprint, cell)` and `requiredClearance(F) = floor(F/2) + 1`.
- About 75 ms per 256×256 map in Lune (load time only).
- Specs (`Passability.spec`):
  - an exact slope value;
  - a depth table across all 9 classes (ships only on deep water, subs deeper, ford limits);
  - a 26.5° ramp that blocks HEAVY_TRACKED, WHEELED and HOVER but not TRACKED or AMPHIB;
  - exact clearance on a hand-built map;
  - a footprint-2 unit rejected in a 1-cell gap and accepted in a 3-cell gap;
  - generated-map invariants and the Lipschitz property of clearance.
- Tests: **12 specs, 92 passed, 0 failed**.
- Decisions: D21–D24. **D21 changes the guide's footprint formula. Please confirm.**
