# Client progress

Progress of the client stream: `src/client`, `src/shared/Defs/Blockouts/`, Studio-only place content and `docs/contracts/`. Branch `m-client-foundation`, worktree `FTGG-client`. This stream is the only one using the Studio connection. The headless simulation (`src/server`, the rest of `src/shared`, `.lune/`) is the sim stream's area; see [`sim.md`](sim.md).

Decisions: `C-1`, `C-2`, ... in [`../decisions/client.md`](../decisions/client.md).

## Merge queue

- Ready to merge: `a2371cd` (CLAUDE.md: Studio is available to the client session only; the sim stays headless and is tested with `lune run test`).
- Ready to merge: `f815a5d` (task 1: Rojo live sync and the in-Studio test entry; touches `CLAUDE.md`, both project files and the skill).
- Ready to merge: `7bbaa7b` (separate `build/serve` and `build/ci` folders, `lune run serve`; touches `.lune/`, `CLAUDE.md`, the project files and the skill; C-3).

## Tasks

1. Studio sync (`STUDIO_HANDOFF.md` step 1) and an in-Studio test entry for `RunAll`. **Done 2026-10-21**, see below.
2. Contracts: `docs/contracts/rig.md`, `docs/contracts/client-state.md`.
3. Blockout generator (guide 20.2), `ord_lancer` and `chs_ravager` first.
4. Client foundation (guide 15): world table from NetIn, interpolation, model pool, RTS camera.

## Task 1: Studio sync and in-Studio tests

- **Sync:** `lune run build` once, then three watchers in the repo root: `rojo sourcemap default.project.json -o sourcemap.json --watch`, `darklua process src build/src --watch`, `rojo serve build.project.json`; connect the Rojo plugin. Studio has 263 scripts (178 Shared, 43 Sim, 41 Tests, 1 Entry), the same as the offline build. No string requires left (two in comments).
- **Test entry:** `src/roblox/RunTests.luau` → `ServerScriptService.Entry.RunTests` (C-1, C-2). From `execute_luau` (Edit): `.start(filter?)`, then poll `.status()`.
- **Result in Studio:** 34 specs, 253 passed, 0 failed (31.8 s and 33.2 s; Lune 17.6 s). No warnings from our code in Output (the Defs loader is quiet).
- **Gotcha (fixed in the follow-up, C-3):** darklua's watcher deleted the output when a source file was replaced by rename (Claude's Edit/Write tools do this) and didn't write it back.

### Follow-up: separate serve and CI folders (C-3)

Rojo's serve crashed (`change_processor.rs` line 179, "The system cannot find the path specified") after `lune run build` wiped `build/src`, the folder it was serving (I ran the build while the sync was up).

- Live sync: `lune run serve` (new `.lune/serve.luau`) keeps `build/serve/src` converted; `rojo serve serve.project.json` serves it. Two terminals instead of three: the script replaces both `darklua --watch` and `rojo sourcemap --watch`. It only writes files and removes the output file of a deleted source; it never deletes a directory.
- Offline build: `lune run build` now wipes and rebuilds only `build/ci/` (`build.project.json`, `build/ci/place.rbxl`; `check_build`'s default follows).
- Tested with the watcher running: add, in-place edit, save by rename (shell and Claude's Edit tool), delete; each synced, no directory removed. `lune run build` alongside left `build/serve` untouched (19 directories before and after). Both trees check clean: 263 scripts, 787 requires.
- Verified in Studio (2026-10-21) with `lune run serve` + `rojo serve serve.project.json`: 263 scripts, no duplicate trees; a probe module added, edited (arrived in 1.3 s, its `@shared` require resolved) and deleted, each reaching Studio. Tests: **34 specs, 253 passed, 0 failed (32.6 s)**. A poll that waits inside `execute_luau` (20 s) was dropped; plain polls work, and one can be dropped while a long test runs.
- Touches `.lune/` (`build.luau`, `check_build.luau`, new `serve.luau`), the sim stream's area, at the user's request. Session A: `lune run build` output moved to `build/ci/`.
- **Not done (handoff step 2, left for later):** the cross-runtime hash check (D51), Script Analysis pass, and the `wait_for_child` question for client requires.
