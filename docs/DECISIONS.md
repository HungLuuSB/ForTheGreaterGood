# Decisions log

Decisions made while working unattended. Each entry gives the date, the decision, the alternatives and the reason. Everything here is meant to be easy to change. Overrule any of them and I'll update the code, the guide and this file together.

## Summary

_Written when the unattended session ends. See `docs/PROGRESS.md` for the full status._

## D1 — Unit modules require `Defs/Templates`, not `Defs` (2026-10-20)

- **Decision:** `Templates.luau` holds the templates and `extend()`. Unit modules use `local Templates = require("../Templates")` and `Templates.extend(Templates.TankT1, {...})`. `Defs.luau` re-exports `Defs.extend` and `Defs.Templates`.
- **Alternatives:**
  - The guide's literal `require("../Defs")`, which is a require cycle because Defs loads the registry and the registry loads the units.
  - Pure-data modules with an `extends = "TankT1"` field, resolved by the loader.
  - Lazy-loading the registry inside Defs.
- **Why:** this keeps the guide's `extend(template, overrides)` style with no cycle and no lazy tricks. Guide 4.2's example is updated to match.

## D2 — Defs are registered by hand in `Defs/Registry.luau` (2026-10-20)

- **Decision:** one module lists every unit and weapon module, keyed by file name. The loader checks each key against the def's `id`.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Enumerate folder children: Instances in Roblox, `@lune/fs` in Lune. That gives two code paths and breaks the "no runtime-specific code outside Util adapters" rule.
  - A Lune script that generates the registry.
- **Why:** it's the only portable option. A generator script can come later if the list gets long.

## D3 — Unknown def fields are errors (2026-10-20)

- **Decision:** any field not in the unit or weapon spec fails validation.
- **Alternatives:** warn only, or ignore.
- **Why:** a typo such as `maxspeed` would otherwise silently fall back to the template value. That is exactly the kind of bug that should "fail loudly in Studio, not mid-match" (guide 4.1). A new field means adding one line to the spec in `Defs.luau`.

## D4 — Separate 1-based index spaces for units and weapons (2026-10-20)

- **Decision:** `unit.index` runs 1..N over units sorted by id, and `weapon.index` runs 1..M over weapons sorted by id.
- **Alternatives:** one shared index space, or 0-based.
- **Why:** packets name the kind of def by context (`defIndex` in BUILD is always a unit, `weaponDefIndex` in SPAWN_PROJ is always a weapon). 1-based matches Luau arrays, and 0 is already reserved on the wire (Schema).

## D5 — Defs hash: FNV-1a 32-bit over a canonical serialization (2026-10-20)

- **Decision:** `Util/Hash.value` walks the built defs with sorted keys and hashes numbers by their IEEE-754 bytes (`string.pack("<d")`).
- **Alternatives:**
  - SHA-256: needs a pure-Luau implementation and is slower, with no security need here.
  - Hashing a formatted string: printf output can differ between platforms.
  - A 64-bit hash.
- **Why:** it's deterministic on every runtime and cheap. 32 bits is plenty to detect a stale client. If accidental collisions ever become a worry, two independent FNV passes give 64 bits.

## D6 — Wrecks deferred; Lancer and Ravager have no `wreck` yet (2026-10-20)

- **Decision:** `wreck` is optional and validated only if present. There are no `neu_wreck_*` defs yet.
- **Alternatives:** add minimal feature defs now.
- **Why:** wreck defs need a feature schema (supply value, footprint, model) that belongs with M2 (deaths and wrecks).

## D7 — Lancer and Ravager stats are placeholders (2026-10-20)

- **Decision:**
  - Both are T1 tracked tanks with armor class ARMORED.
  - Lancer: 1100 HP, cannon with 180 range and 0.5° spread.
  - Ravager: 1300 HP, cheaper, cannon with 160 range, 1.2° spread and more damage.
- **Alternatives:** the LIGHT armor class for light tanks.
- **Why:** they match the faction doctrines in guide 2.1. Balance happens in M8.
